# E-Pharmacy Web App Cypress Tests
This repository contains TypeScript-based Cypress tests for an ePharmacy web application. Leveraging the Page Object Pattern, the codebase is structured to enhance test maintenance, minimize code duplication, and promote reusability.

## Key Features:
* Cypress Framework: Utilizes Cypress for end-to-end testing of the ePharmacy application.
* TypeScript: Tests are written in TypeScript, offering type safety and code consistency.
* Page Object Pattern: Organizes test code into reusable Page Objects to improve maintainability and reduce redundancy.
* Enhanced Test Structure: Structured codebase simplifies test maintenance and encourages code reuse for efficient test development.

## Why the Page Object Pattern?
* Streamline test maintenance by isolating page-specific elements and actions.
* Reduce code repetition and enhance code readability.
* Encourage reusability across tests, promoting a scalable and maintainable testing suite.
